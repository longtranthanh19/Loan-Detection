# Loan-Detection
 This is a loan detection project using machine learning with dataset from Kaggle
 
### Introduction

- In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. The recipient (i.e. the borrower) incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal amount borrowed.

- The whole process of ascertaining if a burrower would pay back loans might be tedious hence the need to automate the procedure.

### Methods 

- Source of Dataset: The dataset for this project is retrieved from kaggle, the home of Data Science.

- The problem at hand: The major aim of this project is to predict which of the customers will have their loan paid or not. Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem to be trained with algorithms like:

1, Logistic Regression
2, Decision Tree
3, Random Forest
